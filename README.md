manage folder to automaticly move a file to destination folder based on theirs extension

"""
you know, i love downloading files, like, game, applications, musics, video, and pdf file.
i store all my downloaded file in one folder it is in 'C:\Users\ANdersoN\Downloads'.
when i opened my download folder, i see bunch of stupid file rigt there, and i decided to manage them, so i created this simple program..
this program will reads a folder contents and will move them to some folder based on theirs extensions. for an example, if a file with name maroon5.mp3 in download folder, then this program will move that file to Music folder. yea. just that. thank you. sorry for my bad english.
